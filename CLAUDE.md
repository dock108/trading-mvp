# Trading MVP Development Documentation

## Project Overview

This project is a **Weekend Sprint Trading MVP** that implements two complementary trading strategies:

1. **Options Wheel Strategy** - Trades SPY, QQQ, IWM using cash-secured puts and covered calls
2. **Crypto Rotator Strategy** - Momentum-based rotation between BTC, ETH, SOL

The MVP provides a complete CLI-driven backtesting environment with comprehensive logging, analysis, and reporting capabilities.

```

### Design Principles Applied

#### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **main.py**: Orchestrates CLI, configuration, and multi-strategy execution
- **Strategy files**: Each implements a single trading approach
- **summary_report.py**: Dedicated to post-execution analysis
- **Functions**: Each has a single, well-defined purpose

#### Separation of Concerns
- **Configuration management**: Isolated in YAML files and validation functions
- **Trade logging**: Standardized format across all strategies
- **Capital allocation**: Dynamic calculation based on enabled strategies
- **Data generation**: Mock data generation separated from strategy logic

#### Dependency Injection
- Strategies receive configuration objects rather than reading files directly
- Capital allocation calculated externally and injected into strategies
- Mock data behavior controlled via configuration flags

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Options Wheel Strategy ✅
**Objective**: Implement cash-secured puts and covered calls on ETFs

**Key Achievements**:

**Technical Details**:
- Performance-based rotation algorithm
- Dynamic position sizing based on available capital
- Cross-asset momentum comparison

### Phase 3: Multi-Strategy Integration ✅
**Objective**: Coordinate multiple strategies with proper capital allocation

**Key Achievements**:
- Dynamic capital allocation (single strategy gets 100%, multiple strategies use percentages)
- Unified trade collection and chronological sorting
- Multiple CSV export formats for different analysis needs
- Comprehensive CLI with detailed help and examples

**Technical Details**:
- Strategy-agnostic execution framework
- Trade log standardization across strategies
- Capital allocation calculation based on enabled strategies

### Phase 4: CLI Integration ✅
**Objective**: Professional command-line interface with robust configuration

**Key Achievements**:
- Complete argparse implementation with detailed help
- YAML configuration with validation and defaults
- CLI overrides for strategy enable/disable
- Multiple output formats (standard, detailed, consolidated CSV)

**Technical Details**:
- Configuration validation with nested field checking
- Error handling with informative messages
- Backtest mode flag for deterministic execution

### Phase 5: Summary Reporting ✅
**Objective**: Human-readable analysis of trading results

**Key Achievements**:
- Weekly allocation tracking through trade reconstruction
- Contextual trade descriptions explaining strategy mechanics
- Performance metrics with final capital calculations
- Strategy comparison and analysis

**Technical Details**:
- CSV reading using exact pattern specified for compatibility
- Chronological iteration for weekly allocation tracking
- Performance metrics calculation with error handling

## Code Quality Improvements

### Refactoring Applied

#### main.py Improvements
- **Function decomposition**: Broke down 75+ line functions into focused, single-purpose functions
- **Constants extraction**: Moved magic numbers to named constants at module level
- **Error handling**: Improved validation with specific error messages
- **Documentation**: Enhanced docstrings with parameter types and examples

#### Strategic Comments Added
- **Complex logic**: Capital allocation logic with single vs. multi-strategy handling
- **Integration points**: CSV format compatibility with summary_report.py
- **Business logic**: Options mechanics and rotation decisions

#### Best Practices Implemented
- **Type hints**: Added where beneficial for clarity
- **Error handling**: Graceful degradation with informative messages
- **Logging**: Structured trade logging with standardized formats
- **Configuration**: Externalized settings with validation

### Testing Strategy

#### Mock Data Design
- **Deterministic sequences**: Reproducible results for development
- **Full cycle demonstration**: Forces complete wheel cycles and rotations
- **Configurable behavior**: Test mode vs. production randomization

#### Self-Test Modules
- **Strategy validation**: Each strategy includes standalone testing
- **Integration testing**: main.py orchestrates multi-strategy execution
- **End-to-end validation**: summary_report.py verifies complete workflow

## Configuration Management

### YAML Configuration Structure
```yaml
initial_capital: 100000

strategies:
  wheel: true
  rotator: true

allocation:
  wheel: 0.5
  rotator: 0.5

wheel_symbols: ['SPY', 'QQQ', 'IWM']
rotator_symbols: ['BTC', 'ETH', 'SOL']
```

### Capital Allocation Logic
- **Single strategy**: Gets 100% of capital regardless of allocation percentages
- **Multiple strategies**: Split capital using configured allocation percentages
- **Dynamic calculation**: Handles arbitrary combinations of enabled strategies

## Trade Logging Format

### Standardized CSV Output
```csv
Week,Strategy,Asset,Action,Quantity,Price,Amount
Week0,Wheel,SPY,SELL_PUT,1,8.55,8.55
Week1,Wheel,SPY,BUY_SHARES,100,427.5,-42750.0
Week2,Wheel,SPY,SELL_CALL,1,6.66,6.66
```

### Enhanced Details CSV
Additional fields: `strike`, `notes`, `timestamp` for comprehensive analysis

### Consolidated Analysis CSV
Includes `strategy_name` field for cross-strategy comparison

## Error Handling Strategy

### Configuration Validation
- **Required fields**: Validates presence of critical configuration
- **Type checking**: Ensures proper data types for calculations
- **Range validation**: Allocation percentages sum to 1.0 (with tolerance)

### Runtime Error Handling
- **File operations**: Graceful handling of missing files
- **Data validation**: Validates trade data before logging
- **Capital constraints**: Prevents trades exceeding available capital

### User Experience
- **Informative messages**: Clear error descriptions with suggested fixes
- **Progressive enhancement**: Applies defaults for missing optional configuration
- **Help documentation**: Comprehensive CLI help with examples

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Management
- **Stream processing**: CSV files processed line-by-line for large datasets
- **Trade collection**: Efficient list operations for chronological sorting
- **State management**: Minimal memory footprint for strategy state

### Scalability Design
- **Strategy extension**: Easy addition of new strategies via common interface
- **Symbol scaling**: Supports arbitrary numbers of symbols per strategy
- **Time horizon**: Configurable simulation length

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

### Next Phase Recommendations

#### Real Market Data Integration
- **Price feeds**: Replace mock data with live APIs (Yahoo Finance, CoinGecko)
- **Market hours**: Respect trading windows and holidays
- **Bid/ask spreads**: More realistic execution modeling

#### Advanced Features
- **Risk management**: Position sizing rules and stop-losses
- **Performance analytics**: Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, volatility metrics
- **Visualization**: Trade charts and portfolio performance graphs

#### Production Readiness
